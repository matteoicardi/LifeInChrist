# Parents' Sessions: First Holy Communion 2025-2026

The purpose of these sessions is to journey with you, the parents and carers, as you prepare your children for their sacraments. Our goal is not just to relay information, but to build a small community of faith together.

We do this by exploring the core Gospel message—the *Kerygma*—as outlined in the book "What Do You Seek?" by Dr. Edward Sri. Through a combination of teaching, reflection, and the sharing of personal testimonies, we hope to create a space where we can all grow in our own relationship with Christ, so that we can better lead our children to Him.

## Part 2: Parent & Child Sessions (Post-Christmas)

In this phase, parents receive catechesis while children attend their own sessions in parallel. The goal is to encourage conversation and shared activities at home.

### Parent Session 4 (Jan 8, 2026): The Incarnation – God Enters Our World

*   **Parents' Catechesis:**
    *   **Kerygma Focus:** Rescue (Part 2) – God's plan culminates in Jesus's coming.
    *   **Anchor Theme:** The Incarnation.
    *   **Key Readings:** John 1:1-14, Luke 2:1-20
    *   **Core Message:** To understand the depth of God's love, who humbled Himself to become one of us. The Incarnation gives our human lives infinite dignity and a hope that withstands any darkness.
*   **Children's Catechesis (Parallel):**
    *   **Unit 1: We Belong**.
    *   **Core Message:** Jesus was born to show us that we belong to God's family.
*   **Home Focus Topic:**
    *   Explore the theme of 'God with us'. How does the story of Jesus' birth show His desire to be close to our families? Connect this to the children's lesson on 'belonging' to God's family, and prepare for the next session's theme of sacrifice by talking about the gifts of the Magi.

### Parent Session 5 (Feb 5, 2026): The Paschal Mystery – Jesus' Gift of Self

*   **Parents' Catechesis:**
    *   **Kerygma Focus:** Reconciliation – Jesus enters our suffering, dies, and rises to save us.
    *   **Anchor Theme:** The Cross and Resurrection.
    *   **Key Readings:** Philippians 2:5-11, Isaiah 53
    *   **Core Message:** The Cross is not a sign of defeat, but of the greatest victory. We explore the meaning of Jesus' sacrifice and how it is made present to us today in the Mass.
*   **Children's Catechesis (Parallel):**
    *   **Unit 3: The Mass**.
    *   **Core Message:** The Mass is a special meal where we remember Jesus' love for us.
*   **Home Focus Topic:**
    *   The children are learning about the Mass as a special meal. At home, discuss the idea of sacrifice as a gift. How was Jesus' death on the cross the ultimate gift of love? Prepare for the next session by thinking about how the Church continues Jesus' presence and mission in the world today.

### Parent Session 6 (Mar 5, 2026): Life in the Church – God's Family

*   **Parents' Catechesis:**
    *   **Kerygma Focus:** Re-Creation & Response – The Holy Spirit makes us new and invites our "yes" to God.
    *   **Anchor Theme:** Communion of the Church.
    *   **Key Readings:** John 6, Matthew 5:1-12
    *   **Core Message:** We are not meant to live our faith alone. The Church is a family, a communion of saints, guided by the Holy Spirit. We explore what it means to respond to God's love within this family.
*   **Children's Catechesis (Parallel):**
    *   **Unit 5: Reconciliation**.
    *   **Core Message:** God is like a loving father who always forgives us when we say sorry.
*   **Home Focus Topic:**
    *   This session is about our response to God's love. As a family, choose one of the Beatitudes (Matthew 5) to talk about. What would it look like to live that out this week? Connect this to the idea of Reconciliation (the children's topic) as a powerful way God helps us 'start again' when we fail to love perfectly.
