# First Holy Communion Programme 2025-2026: Detailed Plan

This document outlines the structure for the First Holy Communion (FHC) programme, integrating parents' catechesis with the children's preparation.

The parents' programme is built on a 6-part proclamation of the Gospel (the *Kerygma*), supplemented by the practical guidance of the *Anchor* booklet. The children's programme runs in parallel, using a dedicated series of booklets.

## Part 1: Parents-Only Sessions (Pre-Christmas)

These initial three sessions establish the foundation of our faith story.

*   **Session 1 (Oct 2, 2025): Relationship**
    *   **Theme:** We were created for a relationship of love with God the Holy Trinity.
*   **Session 2 (Nov 6, 2025): Rebellion**
    *   **Theme:** Sin is a rupture of that relationship, but God does not abandon us.
*   **Session 3 (Dec 4, 2025): Rescue (Part 1)**
    *   **Theme:** God actively seeks us out, forming a people through covenants to prepare for His ultimate rescue plan.

## Part 2: Parent & Child Sessions (Post-Christmas)

In this phase, parents receive catechesis while children attend their own sessions in parallel. The goal is to encourage conversation and shared activities at home.

### Parent Session 4 (Jan 8, 2026): The Incarnation – God Enters Our World

*   **Parents' Catechesis:**
    *   **Kerygma Focus:** Rescue (Part 2) – God's plan culminates in Jesus's coming.
    *   **Anchor Theme:** The Incarnation.
    *   **Core Message:** To understand the depth of God's love, who humbled Himself to become one of us. The Incarnation gives our human lives infinite dignity and a hope that withstands any darkness.
*   **Children's Catechesis (Parallel):**
    *   **Unit 1: We Belong** (using `01 We Belong.pdf`).
    *   **Core Message:** Jesus was born to show us that we belong to God's family.
*   **Suggested Home Activity:**
    *   Set up the family nativity scene together. Spend a moment talking about each figure and the reality that God became a small, vulnerable baby for us.

### Parent Session 5 (Feb 5, 2026): The Paschal Mystery – Jesus' Gift of Self

*   **Parents' Catechesis:**
    *   **Kerygma Focus:** Reconciliation – Jesus enters our suffering, dies, and rises to save us.
    *   **Anchor Theme:** The Cross and Resurrection.
    *   **Core Message:** The Cross is not a sign of defeat, but of the greatest victory. We explore the meaning of Jesus' sacrifice and how it is made present to us today in the Mass.
*   **Children's Catechesis (Parallel):**
    *   **Unit 3: The Mass** (using `02 Mass.pdf` and `Unleavened Bread.pdf`).
    *   **Core Message:** The Mass is a special meal where we remember Jesus' love for us.
*   **Suggested Home Activity:**
    *   Before Mass, briefly show your child the crucifix in the church or at home. Explain that it reminds us of Jesus' great love. Encourage them to listen for the bells during the Eucharistic Prayer as a sign that something amazing is happening.

### Parent Session 6 (Mar 5, 2026): Life in the Church – God's Family

*   **Parents' Catechesis:**
    *   **Kerygma Focus:** Re-Creation & Response – The Holy Spirit makes us new and invites our "yes" to God.
    *   **Anchor Theme:** Communion of the Church.
    *   **Core Message:** We are not meant to live our faith alone. The Church is a family, a communion of saints, guided by the Holy Spirit. We explore what it means to respond to God's love within this family, through sacraments, prayer, and living the commandments in love.
*   **Children's Catechesis (Parallel):**
    *   **Unit 5: Reconciliation** (using `05 Reconciliation.pdf`).
    *   **Core Message:** God is like a loving father who always forgives us when we say sorry.
*   **Suggested Home Activity:**
    *   Light a candle together and say a prayer for your parish family. Talk about how the Sacrament of Reconciliation is a beautiful way God shows his mercy to us through the Church.
