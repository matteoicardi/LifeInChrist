| When I look at your heavens, <br> the work of your fingers, <br> the moon and the stars that you have established; <br> what are human beings that you are mindful of them, <br> mortals that you care for them? <br> Yet you have made them a little lower than God, <br> and crowned them with glory and honor. <br> You have given them dominion over the works of your hands; <br> you have put all things under their feet |
|  **Psalm 8:3-4** |
